# Analysis_of_linear_regression

The project focusses on the analysis of linear regression in depth. The analytical analysis and direct solution of calculating gradients have been discussed. Implemented mini batch gradient descent with various mini batch sizes and analysis of adaptive learning rate in order to minimize error.

**Fastest solution**
At the end, several mini batch sizes and learning rates were implemented to minimize the time taken by the model to train the data.
